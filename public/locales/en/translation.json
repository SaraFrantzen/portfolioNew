  "cvTxt-1": " I hold a mastersdegree in geochemistry from Stockholm University (2012). My eduacation is very research-oriented as I by then was aiming for a PhD. But in the end I realized that it just wasn't right for me.",
  "cvTxt-2": "I've always been a sporty person, during my university period I  was ranked as 2'nd best female boxer in Sweden, and at the same time working extra as a boxers coach myself. Hence it became natural to continue with sports until I figure out what I really wanted to do in life.",
  "cvTxt-3": "Last couples of years I've been living abroad, and I have been thinking more and more about that software development would be a field that should suit me. So I moved back to Sweden and started the Craft Academy Bootcamp to become a full stack web developer. The feeling I have now is that I finally have found inner peace. This is me, I am a developer."
