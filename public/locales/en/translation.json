  "cvTxt-1": " Recently i completed a 12 week long bootcamp by Craft Academy and graduated as a fullstack developer.  I have solid knowledge about backend work and I have been working alot with Ruby on Rails. But I belong in the frontend. I’m skilled in JavaScript, React, React Native and the testing frameworks of Cypress & Detox. I beleive in test driven development, both because I can then deliver code that is proven to work and that it is more efficient to follow the development in a test that directly tells if something breaks.",
  "cvTxt-2": "Since earlier, I have a mastersdregree in geochemistry from Stockholm University which has developed my stratetegic and critical thinking, features that i take advantages of in software development. I chose to change career cause i have more passion to programming and for me it is really important to be passionated about what you do. I love what i do and I feel satisfied when i get to combine creative activity with logical thinking.",
  "cvTxt-3": "I also have a sports career behind me that has given me a lot of personal qualities. I know how to set goals and stay focused, and how important it is to always beleive in myself to reach desired position. But also how important it is to collaborate with the whole team to achieve common goals. I often hear that I’m good at lifting others and that people feel motivated when they work with me.",
